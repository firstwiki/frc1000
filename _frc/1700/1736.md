Robot Casserole, FIRST Robotics Competition Team 1736, is a community-based team in Peoria, Illinois. Students age 14-18 from any private, public, or homeschool high school in the surrounding area are eligible to apply to the team. The team has students from Richwoods High School, Brimfield High School,  and Peoria-area homeschools.  Our mentors include men and women employed at Caterpillar, Ameren, the Peoria Police Department, college students, and others.

The team meets year-round.  From September to early December, students meet with mentors twice a week to learn skills in preparation for the upcoming FIRST Robotics Competition season. January through April includes a six-week robot build season (5 days per week) and competitions. From May through August, we prepare for the upcoming school year and run STEM outreach events such as RoboRumble and RoboMania.  Our team also works year-round promoting STEM education and FIRST programs through a wide variety of activities.
